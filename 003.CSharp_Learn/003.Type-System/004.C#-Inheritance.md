# Inheritance
Inheritance, together with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming. Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. A derived class can have only one direct base class. However, inheritance is transitive. If ClassC is derived from ClassB, and ClassB is derived from ClassA, ClassC inherits the members declared in ClassB and ClassA.(继承、封装和多态性是面向对象编程的三个主要特征之一。继承使您能够创建重用、扩展和修改在其他类中定义的行为的新类。继承其成员的类称为基类，继承这些成员的类称为派生类。派生类只能有一个直接基类。然而，继承是可传递的。如果ClassC从ClassB派生，而ClassB从ClassA派生，则ClassC继承在ClassB和ClassA中声明的成员。)

When you define a class to derive from another class, the derived class implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its constructors and finalizers. The derived class reuses the code in the base class without having to reimplement it. You can add more members in the derived class. The derived class extends the functionality of the base class.(当定义要从另一个类派生的类时，派生类隐式地获得基类的所有成员，但构造函数和终结器除外。派生类重用基类中的代码，而不必重新实现它。可以在派生类中添加更多成员。派生类扩展基类的功能。)

The following illustration shows a class WorkItem that represents an item of work in some business process. Like all classes, it derives from System.Object and inherits all its methods. WorkItem adds six members of its own. These members include a constructor, because constructors aren't inherited. Class ChangeRequest inherits from WorkItem and represents a particular kind of work item. ChangeRequest adds two more members to the members that it inherits from WorkItem and from Object. It must add its own constructor, and it also adds originalItemID. Property originalItemID enables the ChangeRequest instance to be associated with the original WorkItem to which the change request applies.()
